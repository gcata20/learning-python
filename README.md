# **Learning Python**
In January of 2024, I started learning Python by taking *CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python* course. I quickly discovered I enjoy the language and wanted to code a bunch of programs to delve deeper. I created this repository to learn more about git as well, make use of its features and keep a backup of my projects.
