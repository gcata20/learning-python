# **Learning Python**
In January of 2024, I started learning Python by taking *CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python* course. I quickly discovered I enjoy the language and wanted to code a bunch of programs to delve deeper. I created this repository to learn more about git as well, make use of its features and keep a backup of my projects.

### File Sorter
Moves all files from a source folder into categorized subfolders. Input the folder you want sorted and the program will take care of the rest. It loops through each file, matches its extension to a category using a dictionary, creates a subfolder for that category (if one doesn't exist already) and moves the file there. Any files with unrecognized extensions will be moved into a separate subfolder.

### Hangman
The popular game, reimagined as a Python exercise. Play however many games you want and try to win by guessing all letters or the entire word at once. The code reads the "words.txt" file to get a random word at the start of every game so feel free to modify it by adding your own words.

### Password Generator
Generates random passwords. Input your desired length and watch the magic happen. The passwords contain both lowercase and uppercase letters as well as digits. It can easily be modified to include any other special characters you may want for extra security.
